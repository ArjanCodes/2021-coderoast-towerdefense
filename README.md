## Code Roast: Tower Defense

This repository contains both the original and adapted code for the Tower Defense Code Roast, a series where I refactor existing code projects with the aim to improve the design. You can also find the original code here: https://github.com/CharlesFauman/TowerDefense.

This is the link to the refactoring video on YouTube: https://youtu.be/8eWYxNpMjSU.
